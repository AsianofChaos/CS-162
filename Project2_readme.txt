1.Discuss with classmates how you would do the following (and be sure to document your thoughts and submit it with the assignment) to your first week's project code:
    1.how do you think you would add file reading and writing functionality to your menu program,

        File reading and writing functionality can be added by adding 2 new options in the user menu. to do file output all that needs to be done is create a file using the open function and writing the values currently in the Car class.
        To do file input we need to open the file that was written with the file output and then use readlines to create an array with each position in the array being one of the lines containing the values, the values then need 
        to be parsed into just the bare values that a user would input, then they can be put into the car object.

    2.how do you think the try and except clauses of Python work (based on your current understanding or a quick Internet search) and what the FileNotFoundError class is,
        
        The try and except clauses allow you to have some code in between them and there is an error in the code it will instead continue on in the code and then it will run some code if there is an error. The FileNotFoundError is an exception that is raised when
        a file cannot be found when called.

    3.identify sections of your code that you could use to create functions or methods out of,

        The menu section of the code could be made into its own function.
