1. I am intersted in robotics, mechatronics, embedded systems, and a lot of what I have been doing recently, which is automated data acquisition and scientific instrumentation testing.

2. I have historically failed to fully understand object oriented programming and recursion, and for the short amount of time I was trying to use C++ for something, pointers so I will likely still find these things challenging. Other than those things I can't think of anything else right now.
